//! # libcubeb bindings for rust
//!
//! This library contains bindings to the [cubeb][1] C library which
//! is used to interact with system audio.  The library itself is a
//! work in progress and is likely lacking documentation and test.
//!
//! [1]: https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb/
//!
//! The cubeb-rs library exposes the user API of libcubeb.  It doesn't
//! expose the internal interfaces, so isn't suitable for extending
//! libcubeb. See [cubeb-pulse-rs][2] for an example of extending
//! libcubeb via implementing a cubeb backend in rust.
//!

//!
//! To get started, have a look at the [`StreamBuilder`]
