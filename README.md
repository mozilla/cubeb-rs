# cubeb-rs [![ISC License](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/cubeb.svg)](https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb-rs/blob/master/LICENSE)

A cross-platform audio library in Rust.

## Features

Provides access to the following:

- Multiple audio backends across multiple platforms. See
  [here](https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb/wiki/Backend-Support) for details.
- Enumeration of available audio devices.
- Opening input, output and duplex audio streams with control over latency,
  sample rate, channel layout, state transitions, data handling and more.

## Goals

Currently, **cubeb-rs** is based on a set of bindings to the original [**cubeb**
C++ library](https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb) most notable for its use as the
audio backend within
[Gecko](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/search?q=cubeb&unscoped_q=cubeb),
Mozilla's browser engine. The long-term goal for **cubeb-rs** is to become
independent of the C++ library and provide a pure-Rust implementation down to
the level of the platform API eventually replacing the original within Gecko
where possible.

In order to achieve this goal **cubeb-rs** is structured in a manner that
supports backend implementations in both pure-Rust and via bindings to the C++
implementation, allowing for progressive replacement. So far, pure-Rust
implementations exist for:

- Core Audio https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb-coreaudio-rs
- PulseAudio https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb-pulse-rs

The plan is to consolidate all **cubeb**-related projects (including backend
implementations) under a single repository
[here](https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb) in the near future.

While **cubeb** is primarily renown for its use within Gecko, contributions and
use from projects outside of Gecko is very welcome.
